The important issue for qualification to go to war was that bombs released from the aircraft would hit somewhere on the face of the earth. Refresher training for those of us who previously had some skill at weapons delivery took a fast half-dozen missions. The details of how best to cope with crosswinds, adjust for nonstandard release conditions, or even deliver from a tactical popup were left for individual study or learning by experience when we got to our war assignment.
